Secular-Authors
=============

These are some materials which I began to compile during my participation in the course "Computational Methods in the Humanities", taught by Dr. David Birnbaum in the Fall semester of 2014 at the University of Pittsburgh.
This project deals with sociohistorical information related to the authors of the medieval Galician-Portuguese secular poetry.
